### Hi, I'm Ryan.

- I'm currently pursuing a Master's of Science degree in Artificial Intelligence, with a concentration in AI and Software Engineering.  I have been interested in computers and programming since my first PC which was an IBM PS2 with DOS back in the late 80's.  I was mainly interested in just computers then, but my interest in programming has grown over the years.

- I plan on making tutorial based repos here to help learn the topics better and to help others do the same.  The main topics I plan on focusing on are programming in general, programming languages, AI, and math.  I also plan on having some actual programs.

- The main programming languages I am interested in are: Python, Swift, and C.
