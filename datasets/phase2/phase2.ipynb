This suggests that the \"hire\" label’s patterns are well captured with a simpler model, which balances performance with generalization. However, the \"pay\" label demonstrates a clear benefit from added model complexity, as evidenced by higher validation and test F1-scores with the Actual Baseline.\n",

This indicates that the \"pay\" label likely contains more nuanced patterns that a simpler model might miss, making the added complexity of the Actual Baseline worthwhile. In scenarios where computational resources allow, the Actual Baseline is the better choice for maximizing predictive power, particularly on the \"pay\" label. However, if computational efficiency is prioritized, the Dummy Baseline is a solid alternative, delivering high F1-scores with fewer resources."
