in Canada the gender split for family physicians is 50/50. and THEN there are all the other issues
"There's precedent.  The federal govt has found New York City guilty of gender discrimination by not putting nursing on the physically demanding jobs list. https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/page/file/1396636/dl?inline 18. The field of nursing has been, and remains, predominantly female. 19. In 2013, the U.S. Department of Labor reported that 90% of registered nurses were women. See United States Department of Labor, Women's Bureau, 30 Leading Occupations of Employed Women, 2013 Annual Averages, https://www.dol.gov/wb/stats/ leadoccupations.htm. 20. Nursing involves the performance of duties that require heavy physical exertion, as well as a tremendous amount of physical effort, on a daily basis. 21. Nurses' daily physical responsibilities include lifting, moving, turning, transferring, supporting and restraining patients, many of whom are heavy, sometimes mentally ill or intoxicated, and even combative. The majority of a nurse's workday involves walking or standing. Moreover, nurses are vulnerable to workplace violence, in particular, physical assault from patients or patient family members. 22. The physical nature of performing nursing duties substantially increases the risk of back injuries. Nurses suffer a disproportionate number of musculoskeletal disorders during their careers, stemming from the cumulative effect of repeated manual handling of patients. 23. More than half of nurses complain of chronic back pain and 38% of nurses sustain significant back injuries that require leave from work. The policies and practices of defendant City of New York described in Paragraphs 1 through 30, supra, constitute a pattern or practice of discrimination with regard to City- employed Nurses with respect to their compensation and the terms, conditions, and privileges of employment, because of their sex, in violation of Section 707 of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-"
This level of dishonesty and fraud is incompatible with the level of integrity that is necessary to be able to practice safely as an osteopathic physician. The report really couldn't be more damning short of alleging intentional harm (which of course isn't what happened) and makes no attempt to soften its dripping contempt. What a tragedy.
"This is why most of the nurses I work with are DNR-DNI. There is nothing more awful than doing an awakening trial on my intubated patients and we cut off their sedation and expect them to be all chill while CPAPing on the vent. They look terrified. I'm so sorry for the trauma you went through. It's part of weaning from the vent and successful extubation, but truly awful when patients are awake, aware, and restrained. It's no wonder there is such a high incidence of ICU PTSD for patients. For any painful procedure, I don't want to feel it, hear it, smell it, or remember it."
"you're not going to solve all my problems. I appreciate you saying this; but some people absolutely expect this. Not only that, they expect it *now*. I have an appointment on my schedule today that says PA CustomerLittle needs to fix my knee RIGHT NOW. Its hard to estimate how many patients really behave this way because we index for negative experience. But I can pretty firmly say this mentality is getting more and more frequent."
"Shockingly, most females prefer a female Ob/Gyn so they see more patients. Meanwhile payments for Ob/Gyn services are horribly low. Across the country hospitals are closing their Ob department as they lose money.  Female healthy is low priority. Many health organizations alot 15 mins for a female Ob exam. While a male with a urinary problem gets 45 mins with a urologist who gets a significantly higher payment from the govt or insurer. NPs were brought in to alleviate the crunch on physicians by dealing with simple routine cases.  Docs deal with these too but also have 8 or more years of training/debt and deal with the complex life or death problems.  Because I did some welding in HS doesn't mean I should be paid the same as an underwater welder. The hope must be that the NPs lawyers can pull a jury who thinks anyone wearing scrubs is essentially a doc so they should all be paid the same. Suspect the judge will knock the case out on motion practice long before trial."
"This is anecdotal, but when I had appendicitis, sitting down for more than ten minutes would make me see stars, so I was standing up when my back needed a break for laying down. I was also on my phone because how else would I have distracted myself? And I was waiting for surgery, so the pain was obviously intense and the situation serious. You cannot make broad statements like this. People are different and cope in different ways. This is even more true if the pain is chronic - an acute pain will knock you off your feet and scare you, but if you have chronic pain you learn how to managed flares so that they're not all encompassing. This doesn't mean that your pain isn't high. Some things are objective - if a patient is jumping up and down, switching what part of their body they're guarding because they forget where the pain is supposed to be, doing push-ups or whatever - but a lot are subjective and you cannot use to gauge if your patient is actually in the referred amount of pain or not. "
"I waited it out and researched heavily. I worked general ortho for a bit when I moved back to town - I knew I wanted to do spine but I wanted to be picky about who I worked with (I feel like general ortho in comparison is pretty easy to be somewhat happy for me, I like ortho clinics, casting, injections, and the surgeries are usually decent with most of the guys I have worked with) as I previously had worked for a super scary ortho spine guy. So I scoped the area, talking to patients and other docs, and waited for a position to open up within my current company. We were lucky to be a good fit, I work with two surgeons who have somewhat different styles (one does more MIS, the other does larger deformity work) but we mesh really well. All that to say - a little bit of luck, knowing what you are looking for, and being willing to wait for the right job to come along. Being friends with my surgeons and coworkers was a lucky bonus!"
"Insurance doesn't reimburse us for the medication and/or supplies and barely covers the cost of the device. It's shitty that we have to even consider it, but that is our reality. But are you up front with the patient? Do you say, ""This can be an incredibly uncomfortable procedure for some women, but I'm unable to offer procedural sedation because of reimbursements""? This right here highlights the exact issue I was discussing. There is a lack of transparency when IUDs are offered and it makes women distrust their physicians. Many women may pursue other methods of birth control if they had transparent doctors telling them about the pain level associated with insertions/removals. There are plenty of women speaking out about their traumatic insertions and there is now a ton of published journal articles about this as well."
"I had a doctor ask me to find the ultrasound for him. I finished what I was doing and went looking for it. I found it on the other side of the ED, with that same doctor standing next to it talking to another doctor. Then he asked me to take it back to the room he needed it in and proceeded to follow right behind me to that room. It's like seriously?"
