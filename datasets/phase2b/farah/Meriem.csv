I cry myself to sleep from time to time. If i start crying, I won't stop for at least an hour.

I start up every conversation, I don't think anyone has started a conversation first. Even my closest friends, I don't even know if they actually like me.

How do I talk about it to them? I don't want to be a burden to them with my bad mood.

I just want a long hug. But it's weird to ask for one. I don't want to be a ""Where's my hug at"" guy

P.S. Closest friends are female, so it's weird to ask for a hug from them. The same goes for male friends. It's just weird",,,100,FALSE

I have some mental problem but I have no idea what it is.,3,4,"
I (31m) am pretty sure I have some serious mental issue but I am not sure what it is. There are so many problems in my life, I need to solve them all at once. I am overwhelmed. 

I am unemployed. Living in a different country than my parents. Feeling homesick. Need money for my mother’s knee replacement surgery. She is in pain. Father is diabetic and getting old. I need to pay off my student loan. 

My self esteem and confidence is at lowest. I go blank and choke during job interviews. 
I can’t focus when I try to study. Can’t retain the concepts that I have read. 

I don’t feel happy anymore, nothing makes me happy. Beautiful scenery, music, movies I can’t feel any of these anymore. I have no love life. I don’t feel romantic anymore. If I go 4 years back I was very happy, excited about life. Felt a wide spectrum of happy emotions in those days. But not anymore. 

When I try to go to sleep I keep flexing and clenching my toes. Keep tossing and turning in bed. Then thoughts start racing in my mind, just like racing frames in Marvels opening theme. I can’t even explain any better. What could it be?

I really need a advice or a schedule to follow. I do night shift but whenever I am not in work. I feel like shit. I constantly smoke even though I don't like it. I  feel like I am doing something when smoking. Why?? Am I like this?? It's not like I don't have friends, but recently I have been getting feelings like they don't really care. Not that I am rude or something, I always try to make every little thing fun whenever I am with my friends. But multiple times I get the feeling that I don't belong there. Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyy?????

Why do people get angry and aggressive when they are worried for someone?,2,6,"I get that my dad is angry at me for drinking because he's afraid that I will not stop and ruin my life and health but shouting and me and almost hitting me seems like a paradoxical reaction. Does he think this will make me stop? I get that it's harmful and I'm trying to stop but him acting like this just makes me want to not exist which in turn makes me want to drink myself into a coma or get high in some way because that's the only way I know how to numb myself. I wasn't even acting stupid or anything I'm totally coherent I'm just under the influence of alcohol.

I just want to understand why some people act aggressive when they are worried for someone to help me understand my dad.

How to help my 2 year old through father’s abandonment,8,6,"My husband and partner of 17 years recently blindsided me by announcing he had started an affair with a co worker and would be leaving th family immediately to be with her. 

Putting my own immense betrayal / attachment trauma aside, we have a 2y4m old and since dad has moved out (moved straight in with affair partner), he has suddenly expressed emotions that have surprised me in realizing he has an understanding of what is going on.

The other morning, we were cuddling in bed and he said “I feel sad” I said why do you feel sad and he said “Well.. my daddy’s gone”. 

Those words broke my heart all over again. He’s said it again today and has asked where’s daddy gone. I want my daddy.

I have not said anything at all about daddy leaving, I haven’t really acknowledged it with my toddler and have/would never bad mouth him to my child.

I haven’t told his dad yet that his son has expressed this, but I think I will. He is visiting two evenings a week and a weekend afternoon.

Do antidepressants actually numb you?,3,8,"Hi everyone

Those who have been taking antidepressants or anti-anxiety pills or any mental health medicine, did it help you manage your emotions?

How to continue to be kind when being frequently dismissed and invalidated?,3,4,"Hello, just as my post says I’m looking for advice on how to continue to be kind and keep my cool when facing frequent dismissal and invalidation? 

I understand that I can only be in control of my own thoughts and feelings. And others are responsible for their own. But what I find challenging is when the invalidation is so frequent that eventually you get to a breaking point and say something mean or harsh to the people who invalidated. When people just keep being invalidating it can sometimes make me want them to understand what it feels like and put it into a perspective they will understand.

I started Lexapro (escitalopram) 5mg three days ago for depression. Since then, I have been ridden with an intense anxiety in my chest, restlessness, and irritability.

I have reasons to believe this is some phycological issue but I never know if it's worth seeing a psycologist about it(a teacher once recommend me to see one) I need help to identify whether or not if I need to see a psycologist about this or if there is other ways to solve my crying issue. Or mabye I'm over reacting and it's jest a slightly less common trait of human personality, I just need help to stop crying over little things.

I am making an account so that I can create this post. 

I do not and have never not felt alone. I have spoke about this briefly in the past but people become offended and do not understand, so I stopped asking them about it. I have read many threads here and all over reddit about other people also feeling alone, and none of the responses that helped them seem to help me.

So, the typical advice like ""get friends, find love, work out"" does not seem to apply to me, I am already doing the things typically recommended. 

The problem is I always feel alone. With 1 person, with a 1000. With a Friend, with a Stranger. No matter what, I always feel alone.

Hi everyone!

My name is Ejder.

I'm 25 years old and I'm not like the guys around me, I'm more emotional and I care too much about my relationships, sometimes my girlfriends get bored because I care too much.Most men I know are uncaring and relaxed.

What has helped with your mental health the most? (Don't say therapy/meds... what else?),49,180,"Therapy is expensive, and finding a good therapist is hard. Seeing a psychiatrist is expensive, the diagnosis might be inaccurate, and finding the right medication usually requires time-consuming titration and one might experience possible side effects. Basically, working with a mental health professional is costly and takes a LOT of patience... at least from personal experience: over 9 years, I've seen 6 therapists, 2 psychiatrists, received 3 different diagnosis and am regularly on meds - they do seem to help!

  
However, in 2 recent depressive episodes, I noticed that having a regular exercise regime has helped my mood significantly: I'd do HIIT classes 3-4x a week, and a weekly hike. Getting daily sunlight (or blue light) has also helped. No change in meds.

  
I've read that various supplements (magnesium, fish oil, vit Bs), diets (Mediterranean, keto) and types of exercise (weightlifting?) can help... but tbh it's all pretty overwhelming to figure out.

It never occured to me what happened might have been harmful until my psychologist pointed it out. 

I never even mentioned this to anyone and now that I have to face it I can’t bear to do it. Even in a “safe-space” and alone I face difficulties and it seems impossible to ever talk about it openly.

How do you live a lonely life?,47,41,"
I’m 37M. No parents, siblings, cousins, partner or kids. 
Few close friends who are scattered across the globe. None in my city.
Fairly social person. Moved to a new city a couple of years ago. No friends as such here and I don’t think it’s even possible at this point. People around my age group are busy with their own families and life. Have some short term romantic interests now and then but I’m scared of getting entangled in a long term marriage. 

I realized that my life is ultimately just going to be me. Kind of a lonely and scary thought especially for old age. How should one frame their mental attitude, goals, motivation and inner dialog when you lead a life alone. ",,,,FALSE
I would've died in that house,46,8,"Today I broke down on my boyfriend. I recently put two and two together that my chronic back problems that have already put me in the hospital 3 times, are mostly caused by the years of abuse I endured as a child and teen, being forced into hard labour for up to 12 hours a day. 

It's really hard to face. That I went through so much suffering waiting for freedom, and now that I have it, the abuse is still effecting my quality of life. I really broke down, and ended up having a really beautiful moment with the man I love.

When I'm like that, it's very clear that it hurts him. He holds me so tight, it's like he's trying to hold me together. Just repeating ""I'm here, I'm not going anywhere. You're okay. I love you"".

I told him, no matter what happens between us, or how much times passes, I'll never be able to not love you. I would've died in that house.

Because I would have. For so so many years, I dreamed of someone coming to save me. I dreamed of someone that could love me. And I never thought it would actually happen but if he hadn't cared for me, more time would've passed, and I would've eventually given in. 20 years was long enough. He saved my life.",,,,FALSE
Recording people and posting it online to shame them is a form of abuse,42,8,"There are so many videos like this on the internet and here on reddit. Sometimes it’s making fun of someone doing something embarrassing but then usually there’s some sympathy in the comments saying that it’s not fair to be laughing at this person. But sometimes it is a video of a person doing something wrong and then the general consensus seems to be that they deserve to be shamed. well ok. So maybe they deserve punishment but don’t you think that posting videos like this online is like lynching? 

I just saw a video of a woman screaming racist things on a train but it was pretty obvious that she was mentally ill. she was talking to people who weren’t there. I think recording this and putting it online is a form of abuse. We don’t know what’s this person’s problem. we don’t have a back story. But we really like to vilify others and feel self-righteous. and even if she was truly just racist, still what’s the point of putting this online? two wrongs don’t make a right. 

Personally, I think that the internet is really doing a lot of harm to modern society. I think it would be much better to walk up to a person causing the nuisance and explain that they are bothering others. But instead people stay away and take out their phones to ridicule them online. ",,,,FALSE

I’ve been struggling in school a lot recently, for a variety of reasons. Some due to depression, some due to anxiety, some due to lack of sleep, and some even because my pet died recently. Nobody understands me. 


I talked to my ESE teacher about it. What was the first thing he said? Was it “I’m sorry I’ll speak to your teachers about it”? Was it “I’m sorry I had no idea you were going through that”? Was it “I’m sorry you have to experience that”? Or even just something as simple as “Is there anything I can do to help you?”? No. None of that. Not even close. All he said was “well these missing assignments should be your main concern”.

I’ve cried every single day. All I want is support in school.



I wish people cared more about my mental health and my wellbeing more than a fucking number. I wish more people cared about that more than my attendance.

He also said that I shouldn’t be taking naps after work because then it prevents me from being able to sleep later and that I should just push through it. Even though i’ve explained to him that i’m not just being lazy, my medication just makes me very tired. 

Also please note that I live alone in my apartment, I have a full time job, I take care of myself and I’m successful. I’m jot just a lazy bum who sleeps all day. 

After a few comments like these I decided to break up with him because I realized that he just has no empathy towards me and my condition… ",,,,FALSE

I've struggled with depression since my teenage years, and now, at 22 yo, I've come a long way. Sadly, I'm still suicidal, but some days are better than others, and I try my best to not let my immediate family see that all the time.

  
We were on our way to a birthday party, when my little cousin told me my other cousin's friend was afraid of meeting me. I jokingly said ""Well, she should be! I'm made of anger!""

In response, she said: ""Tata (my nickname) is not angryness, Tata is happiness.""

I always try to make people happy, and always have a smile on. She doesn't know everything about my depression. She knows that Tata went away for a while while I was at the mental hospital. That sometimes Tata is sick, and can't play.

How to get a doctor to take you seriously?,18,31,"Hi everyone, I have an appointment on the upcoming Monday regarding my anxiety & I haven't tried to seek help for it after the last experience I had at the doctor's.

My question is how do you approach a doctor and get them to believe you? Maybe I did just get unlucky last time, but I wanted to ask for advise, I'm not sure if this is a silly question to ask tbh.

It is all therapy stuff I've learned (of course!) over the years...coping skills...rationally thinking through my thoughts (when I am able to do that, otherwise I just let those thoughts linger for a second and let them move on)...

What in the actual heck?😂

Dang it...

I guess a plus (and a definite W) is that I don't have to pay it for therapy sessions lolol!

Just thought you guys would appreciate a little humor this morning. I am feeling so happy. My medication really DOES take away the anxiety completely. I was thinking back to before I had taken it this morning. I was laying in bed, restlessly thinking about everything I had to do today, and wanting to do none of it. It was such an awful restless, dissatisfied feeling. I took my meds (all of them) and now I am at my Partial Hospitalization Program, listening to music and coloring happily in my coloring book. Yeah. It's basically a daycare with therapy lol.

Interesting how my anxiety was keeping my mind from thinking rationally about stuff (organizing and taking my time planning stuff out) but the medicine helped me calm my mind...

Do therapists really care about their clients?,16,55,"

I am thinking of going to a therapist. I kinda crave that connection or chemistry that you make with people before you can get comfortable with them. But I sometimes wonder, do they really care about their clients apart from the surface level transactional relationship of money?

I know that therapist or counselor can't form personal relationship with the client. But a question to the mental health professionals - do you really grieve the loss of life of your client?

I am asking this because of the continuous apathy that I see in life- it really makes me question whether anyone cares or not.

Why do bad people get treated so well?,13,10,"Now I’m sure this isn’t an objective observation but it seems like, in my experience, people who are unbelievably awful get more forgiveness and empathy than the average person does.

My girlfriend thinks she doesn't deserve to be alive,12,14,"I (M25) have been with my girlfriend (F25) for 18 months now and I love her so so much, I have no doubt I want to spend my life with her. 

For a bit of background, she is awaiting an autism diagnosis. She has a lot of childhood trauma that she is slowly working through the best she can from growing up with her abusive mother. 

A few months after we started seeing each other, she cut her mother off and hasn't spoken to her in the last 15 months or so. Since then, her autism has really taken over along with her anxiety and depression. 

She has recently moved into her own flat after 8 months of living with me at my parents house. Since then, she has really started to struggle and is saying that she ""doesn't deserve to be alive"", she is ""a broken person and should never have been born"" and that ""everything around her and in her head is telling me I should go"". 

How am I best to support her during this and help her get through to the other side?

My inability to say no is ruining my relationship,11,8,"I'm 23F.
Quick history about my childhood: I grew up with emotionally neglectful parents who only focused on my younger sister (she has mental difficulties). I never got a ""good job"" in my academics and hobbies so I had to set my own standards, which were unhealthily high. Ensue me constantly feeling like a failure and hating myself. This leads to a whole can of other issues.

I then begin to seek validation in other people in highschool. I join clubs and plays to seek friends but don't make any. I was (still am) constantly falling into the ""if I do whatever they say, maybe they'll be my friend"" trap. This mindset has wrecked several aspects of my life. I just can't  say no. The idea that I've disappointed someone literally brings me to tears, even if they are a complete stranger. 

This has resulted in some very awful situations for me and I let my boundries be broken all the time. As you can imagine, my fiancé doesn't trust me anymore because of my inability to say no to people. 

The worst part is I don't even realize Im uncomfortable until a few moments later. I've become ""emotionally illiterate"" and people please as a default.

Tldr: I hate myself, look for validation, can't  say no, break a boundary, then hate myself again. Cycle repeats.

Is there anyway I can fix this behavior in myself?

But since these recurring nightmares, I haven't been able to look at myself the same. I look at myself without feeling so discussed.

Now, I have to stress that this is just an extreme example and doesn’t send me over the edge, but it’s like the first 1% of my irritation. Even something as mild as this annoys me on some level. I realize this is just normal conversation, but for some reason, I can’t seem to deal with the underlying intention or the pretense behind it anymore.

Need urgent help/psychiatrist consult,4,8,"Hello folks, I am from Ontario and have been facing mental health issues for some time now.

Over the last 6 months, I've consulted a psychotherapist at my college and attended one therapy session every two weeks. I cannot say that it hasn't helped, but things are not moving in the right direction. 

I won't be able to fully describe my mental health issues, but to summarize, I'm forgetting things more often, getting lost in familiar neighborhoods, and have even had trouble getting back home at times.

Additionally, I have been feeling depressed lately and have lost joy in life. These sessions are no longer helping, and it is high time I get the right consultation. I'm not a Canadian resident, but I have health insurance coverage provided by my college, which includes mental health.I do not have a family doctor, and I've heard that only physicians can refer someone to a psychiatrist. 

I can try booking a walk-in appointment with a physician, but can someone please tell me what the chances are that they will refer me to a psychiatrist right after my first appointment? How long does it usually take to get a psychiatrist's appointment after being referred? 

I understand healthcare here is expensive; a rough estimate of how much it would cost me would be great.

Do antidepressants actually numb you?,4,8,"Hi everyone

Those who have been taking antidepressants or anti-anxiety pills or any mental health medicine, did it help you manage your emotions?

How do I (36m) regain control of my thoughts and behaviors after excessive exposure to NSFW content online?,6,15,"Here's a more message board-friendly version of your post that still expresses your concerns but in a slightly less explicit way:

**How do I (36m) regain control of my thoughts and behaviors after excessive exposure to NSFW content online?**

I've noticed that browsing NSFW subreddits has had a negative impact on my mental health. It has increased my preoccupation with sexual thoughts and desires to the point where I'm thinking about it almost constantly. This has also amplified my exhibitionism tendencies, and I find myself looking for ways to engage in it, even in small, private ways.

It’s starting to affect how I perceive others, as I find myself thinking about sexual scenarios or details regarding people I see in everyday life. This isn't who I want to be, and it's interfering with my ability to focus on anything outside of this mindset.

My psychiatrist helped me overcome my fears with this,4,4,"I have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and when I first went to see a psychiatrist, one thing he educated me on was exposure therapy.

He explained if we took someone who is afraid of heights and put them on top of the Eiffel tower, at first of course they’re going to be scared. But, the body cannot withstand that fear for too long, so it will adapt to get used to the fear and start to overcome it - to restore balance.

With my OCD, once I started facing it head on, no longer willing to run from it and let it control me, I finally took it’s power away and started getting it under my control.

 Last night I got about 6 hours of sleep and got to sleep in my own bed which was definitely the best sleep I’ve got all week.

Is it ethical to take mental health medication that you don't need to take?,3,21,"I am thinking of requesting a medication from my physician that I don't *need* but I know will likely improve me feelings of well-being.  I could achieve this same improvement in different, non-pharmaceutical ways, but I wouldn't mind the ease of just popping a pill.  

The part that gets me is whether this is ethical.  Like, if someone wanted sleeping medication because they didn't want to put the effort into good sleep hygiene, should they be prescribed it? Is it better to just have them access the improvement that leads to a better quality of life no matter how they do it, or should there be an emphasis on managing it using strategies that are accessible to oneself rather than external supports like medication?

I realized that I don't likely have the myriad of disorders I was diagnosed with, and have since come off of the majority of my medications.  That hasn't been an issue.  However, one of the medication did make me feel ""better"" but it wasn't through the resolution of any of the symptoms that it was meant to treat.

I'm content being like this although to some point it does get pretty lonely, even when I'm waiting in line in the cafeteria I just have the feeling there are hundereds of eyes just starting at me making me feel awkward and embarrased even though I know I haven't done anything.  Someone asks me to send homework? I'll send it just cause I feel like I have to even though I know I have no obligation whatsoever it makes me feel if I don't do that one specific thing I'll be left out even more.

Lost my job,3,5,"Hey all, idk why I’m really posting other than I don’t really know what else to do right now. 

A couple weeks ago I lost a job I loved, fired with no warnings and no write up’s. I can’t prove it, but I feel it happened because I didn’t react to the president of the companies yelling at me over my first ever mistake there. 

I’ve never had a job I both enjoyed the coworkers, and didn’t mind the work. It was a nice break after 2020-2022 rocked my world. During that time I dropped out of college, lost my job then, and my father and grandfather passed within 6 months of each other.

My therapist wants me to take a real  break from work for a few months, cause he says he feels I’m burned out, and that only taking 2 months after my dad passed wasn’t long enough and that I’ve been running on empty ever since (roughly 4 years now)

How to continue to be kind when being frequently dismissed and invalidated?,3,4,"Hello, just as my post says I’m looking for advice on how to continue to be kind and keep my cool when facing frequent dismissal and invalidation? 

I understand that I can only be in control of my own thoughts and feelings. And others are responsible for their own. But what I find challenging is when the invalidation is so frequent that eventually you get to a breaking point and say something mean or harsh to the people who invalidated. When people just keep being invalidating it can sometimes make me want them to understand what it feels like and put it into a perspective they will understand. 

I am aware of many DBT skills and do make the attempt to use them but what’s the best recourse when you are past the window of tolerance?

Struggling with Separation from My Daughter – Seeking Support from Others in Similar Situations,3,5,"Am going through a really tough time and would appreciate any advice or support from others who have faced similar challenges.

Earlier this year, I got to spend another 3 weeks with her, only to be forced to distance myself again.

No matter how much I try to concentrate on work, I keep getting lost in memories of my daughter. It’s hard to keep my head straight, and I feel like I’m constantly fighting to stay focused.

Context:

	•	Spouse: She is non-responsive and only reaches out when it’s time for daycare payments. I continue to pay, hoping it helps my daughter make friends and be social.
	•	Travel: I’ve tried traveling to manage my emotions, but it hasn’t worked.
	•	Marriage: I’m going through a failed marriage, which makes everything more complicated.

I’m so ashamed of being gross and hypersexual,315,69,"
Ever since I could remember, started around 8- 10, never stopped.
It’s been 10+ years and it has never calmed down, never ever, I thought it was just a normal part of being a teen but it’s gotten worse and more disgusting as I got older.

I can’t help it, I can’t fucking help it, everything needs to be sexualized, my art, everything I wear, the things I talk about, everything, I’ve been sexualizing my poor hygiene caused to deteriorating mental health, it’s so fucking gross, but it makes me feel so calm and comforted.

Everything, everything everything I do needs to be sexualized, my struggles needs to be sexualized, everything.

I’ve developed weird kinks due to being exposed to them at a young age, they just never left, I indulge and indulge and indulge only to have them become more extreme and gross.

Everything I do needs to be sexual, every single little thing, everything I make, everything I think about, it’s clogging up my fucking mind and I can’t get a break, not even a 10 minute break where I can just be normal.

I don’t have a history of abuse, which confuses me, I don’t know why I’m like this which just makes me hate it even more.

But when I get home and take it off, I’m hit with the harsh reality of how I actually look. It’s like a constant reminder that no matter how much I try to boost my appearance, it’s just not the same.

I feel less like a woman and genuinely believe that no one will ever love me because of how I look. What hurts the most is knowing that the only way to change this might be through a cosmetic procedure, but those are very expensive, and I don’t have the funds for that.

I’ve tried everything—gaining weight (which is tough due to my fast metabolism) and supplements—but nothing seems to make a difference. I feel like I don’t deserve to be taken seriously by men, and while I know people say life isn’t all about men (and I wholeheartedly agree) I still want them to find me attractive because they’re my preferred gender, but I feel like I will never achieve that because of the way my body is.",,,,FALSE

Please Stop Recommending Pets as a Mental Health Fix,283,54,"I’ve seen this several times under a lot of posts on this Reddit, and I’m not saying pets don’t help. I don’t want to discount the experiences of people who says pets have helped with their mental illnesses, and I don’t want to discredit scientific studies that suggest having a pet elevates your mood.  However, a pet is a living creature that requires a lot of care, and if you are so depressed it is hard to keep up with your responsibilities, a pet might add to your stress rather than helping relieving it. This really reminds me of those couples who fight and fight and they think having a baby will fix their relationship. 

Please remember that pets aren’t props used to help humans, they are living creatures with their own feelings and needs. I don’t want to discourage you from getting a pet, but please only get one if you can take care of it, not just to help with your mental health.

Boyfriend has Derailed Thought Disorder,121,58,"My (40F) BF (45M) considers himself an above average intellectual. He is a Data Analyst as a profession. He is proficient in 3 languages. English is not his first language. But it is mine, so we communicate in English. 

He often likes to speak about science, physics etc and he goes on long tangents to prove a theory. The tangents begin with one point and go on to a couple different subjects not related to the original point he was trying to prove. I chalk up some of this disconnected points to English not being his first language. 

I struggle to follow along because I'm always trying to connect what he is saying to his original theory. When he's finally done talking I say ""you lost me babe"" and he laughs and says ""I know, I'm a deep thinker"". Out of frustration I want to say ""NO, that's not deep, you've just made NO SENSE at all!"" 😩 But I've never said this. Instead I distract with a more basic conversation like ""what's for dinner?""

I felt fine. Sure I was sad some days but never like how I am now. This is depression and anxiety fully at work with me now.

What the movies don’t tell you about trauma,98,15,"I’m rewatching that scene from the last of us where the main character endured something horrible and she was scared and crying and her father figure calms her down and just holds her and called her his baby girl like he called his own daughter.

And I think that’s why people romanticize trauma so much. 

But what the movies don’t tell you is that sometimes, you get raped and afterwards you cry and cry cry cry cry in the bathroom and scrub yourself clean. And you go to sleep and then you go to class in the morning like nothing happened.

Anyway. All tests revealed that I’m not epileptic. I had PNES. And I also had several mental breakdowns where I took out my IV cannula, shouted at the nurses for giving me poison through IV fluids (I was on A LOT bc my lactate levels were high and not coming down).

Recently i’ve been feeling like i lack discipline, and how often i masturbate felt like a big issue with that, i would masturbate twice a day, and i never had a girlfriend so i sort of would watch porn, and i hate porn, always have, i don’t enjoy it, it makes me feel off, so now im trying to stop masturbating all together, but i feel so aroused 24/7 now, wake up in the nights sometimes, random erections, ive been trying to cut down for half a year now, but feeling aroused just won’t go away. Part of me knows its normal to feel sexual urges, so i feel like masturbating a couple times a week is normal, but i don’t know if im telling myself this because i want to make a compromise due to lack of discipline with it, but even if i do masturbate couple times a week, i don’t want to watch porn, instagram models, none of that stuff, so i don’t know what to do in that respect lol, can’t believe im saying this lol, but its true.",,,,FALSE

War, politics, environment, society, economy... Feels like everything is just getting worse and worse.

As a depressed autistic person, I can't help but feel like it's all too much. And thus, I need to find ways to cope with our current reality. What I'm doing rn is just... ignore it.

What's something that your parents did as a child that fucked you up?,86,92,"Honestly, I love my parents, and most of the time they're nice, but some of their behaviors triggered what I think is severe anxiety. I don't even know.

2) not showing interest in MY interests. When I was growing up, my parents (esp. my mom) didn't really show any reaction to what I liked.

I've been feeling so low about it it's giving me some really dark thoughts and I don't know who to talk to about it or what to do to make it stop. there's this dark voice in my head that's almost getting a masochistic high from it all, and I've started seeking it out, like yes all these people have even more reasons why you are inherently worthless subhuman and unloveable. I'm really struggling badly. I also have diagnosed body dysmorphia and it's just not been a good mix. I've been ruminating on the thought that I;ve just fucked my whole life up so bad and I'm not good enough and how desperately I just wish I was ANYONE else instead of having to be me and live with all my stupid thoughts in my stupid head that just won't stop",,,,FALSE
I did it. I paid for dinner.,79,10,"I got my first ever salary after completing my undergrad and postgrad. I took my family out to dinner today to a 5 star hotel. I took the bill from my father's hand as I said I'll be handling it today and paid for it. Here it's why it was special for me.

I come from a poor family. This tale is from when I was 6 or 7. I was out with my father to his office and while returning, I said that I was hungry and we went a street side shop, I ate happily. My father didn't eat. After completing the meal, he asked me if I wanted to eat more but I said no. We then boarded the public bus, he took out wallet and emptied it for the bus fare. I asked then how we would have gone home if had paid for extra food which I said no to, he just smiled and never gave me a response. I always had a lot of conflicts with my father, but that incident always reminded of the great father he is and I will never be as selfless as him. So, when I took the bill today and made the payment, he gave the similar warm smile like the one he gave me on that bus. I did it guys, he didn't say anything to me after that. I hope he is proud of me.",,,,FALSE

Or that ""doing things for other people"" could justify living. I am sorry, but if I'm not remotely taken care of to the extent I cannot meet my basic needs, then I begrudge anyone else that benefits from my existence. Why is the assumption that everyone else is worth more than us, and that our helping them is automatically supposed to make our lives better? It seems absurd to me.

Can we stop with ‘cringe’?,80,48,"I am so tired of this expression. It seems its sole purpose now is to externalise shame onto others. I recognise that shame (and in the cruellest sense, shaming) is a useful way of enforcing social norms, but it seems like this whole ‘cringe’  weaponises shame rather than making it sympathetic or constructive. It’s as if there’s a joy in pointing it out with no regard for the psychology behind it.

Full disclosure, this is coming from emerging from a life of social anxiety and realising how projecting shame can be hard for those who’re trying to recover. The unfortunate part is I now notice “cringe” in everything where I didn’t in the past and it’s getting in the way of recovery. Has anybody dealt with this?

I feel like no one likes me, I get so lonely. I feel like I could disappear from te face of the wart and no one would even notice unless they needed something from me. Because that’s how it feels, like all I do is give and provide and no one appreciates or reciprocates. 

It’s one breakdown after the other and I don’t have anyone I can talk to about it. My “friends” wouldn’t understand or they’d just start treating me weird.

A lot of my older friends would say to me ""Imagine being straight"" or ""imagine being cis"" and it actually hurts because they would say those things to me a bunch of times and it kinda makes me feel less ""cool"" I guess because everyone would treat me differently whenever I would say I'm straight or I'm not trans and it hurts a lot I just wanna be treated the same in my friend groups and I don't want anyone to feel unsafe around me- whenever I say ""I just feel masculine sometimes"" my friends would automatically say ""Well your probably nb"" and it sounds made up i know.

What excuses can I give for a giant scar on my hand? 2 Years old.,62,55,"I have a giant scar, it will never fade properly and it has been two years, but it's white/pink & it's pretty thin, they're actually two scars covering the entire length of the back of my hand, they're shaped in a V.

A psychologist lady person asked if a dog attacked me, idk if she knew and was just trying to get me to say the truth, or if that's what she actually thought. I don't know if this scar will make me lose job opportunities in the future, and it's practically impossible to cover even with makeup, I think it looks a little too clean to be a dog scar, and way too deep, but maybe?

For example, she may suddenly become upset and fixated on something that happened ten years ago.

Tonight while we were talking she became unusually upset at something I had done that day. She became fixated on it, even after I had apologised, then cried her eyes out. The emotional reaction was not at all proportionate to the thing upsetting her.

A couple years ago I found out that I wasn't the only student he was grooming. Not surprised by it but it definitely validated my experience. 

I have been so hypervigilant because of him. I see a car that looks like his and my heart races and I start to panic. I hear his name, the school, the subject, and immediately think of him and what he did. There's a guy at my gym that looks like him and every time I see him I stop breathing and freeze. 

I was too afraid of retaliation to speak up. Even though I dropped out and moved, I was still scared he would find me or my family if I said anything. I felt, and still feel guilty for not reporting him. 

Today, I found out he died from a drunk driver in June 2023. 

I feel relieved knowing he will never be able to hurt anyone ever again. I know this isn't magically going to take away what he did to me and others. It will continue to impact me, but I'm looking forward to being able to feel even just a tiny bit more free knowing he can't hurt me.

Endocrinologist at Childrens Hospital says if we choose not to take hormone blockers or implant, she’ll most likely get her period before the age of 10.

How to stop people pleasing?,54,42,"

Hey,
I've been thinking a lot about my behavior towards other people over the last few weeks. I'm a people pleaser and it's really bothering me. On the one hand, I'm ashamed of the fact that I'm always adapting to new people and can never say no because I'm totally afraid of not being liked. On the other hand, the associated overthinking and anxiety the day after is extremely exhausting. After a meeting (especially with people I don't know that well), I can't think about anything other than the fact that I've behaved strangely and they probably don't even like me anyway. I also sometimes hate myself because I know that I'm a people pleaser and always want to please everyone. 
Incidentally, I've been in therapy for a few years and am currently working on this very problem.
Nevertheless, it would be extremely great if anyone had one or more helpful tips on how to slowly but surely get rid of this kind of behavior.

Life is 100% luck,55,32,"Life is 100% luck, beginning right from the moment of conception. This initial stroke of luck dictates crucial aspects such as your genetic makeup, geographical location, and socioeconomic status. Your genes, which are a product of this genetic lottery, determine not only your physical attributes but also your susceptibility to various health conditions, including mental health issues. If you are predisposed to mental health challenges, this biological luck places you at a significant disadvantage from the start, affecting your capacity to thrive in numerous aspects of life.

Furthermore, the location where you are born profoundly impacts your opportunities and quality of life. Being born in a region with ample resources and stable governance offers a starkly different set of prospects compared to being born in a war-torn or impoverished area. Similarly, the wealth of the family you are born into can open doors to education, healthcare, and social connections that are pivotal for personal development. Thus, these elements of luck—genes, location, and wealth—collectively shape the trajectory of your life, often in ways beyond your control, underscoring the pivotal role that luck plays from the very outset of our existence.",,,,FALSE

Does showing your emotions as a man ever work out in your favor?,49,74,"There's been discussion for years around men not showing their emotions and struggles and how it negatively affects them. My experience is that in general other men are incapable of empathizing with you and kind of ""ctrl + alt + delete shutdown"" in raw bewilderment at the sight of another man showing a softer side. They literally cannot handle it.

Alternatively, women can be more empathetic on the whole, but generally it feels it is seen as a weakness and liability particularly in a romantic relationship but also as friends, and you are treated with pity and kid-gloves from then on. Overall my takeaway has been that nothing good comes from being vulnerable and showing this side of you.

- Some of my friends may not actually exist
- the world is run by doppelgängers humans who are trying to destroy the real humans in order to reshape the world in their image.

Usually, the other person would command me more angrily, ""Speak up!"" Later, I realized this was the freeze response at play.  
2.Habitual apologies:  
I constantly apologize for various trivial matters. If I'm particularly anxious, I'll repeat apologies over and over again. Even when told to stop apologizing, I reflexively apologize again. This habitual apology behavior makes me constantly reflect on my faults, even those that aren't mine, and often leads me to doubt myself.  
3.Fear of seeking help:

What has helped with your mental health the most? (Don't say therapy/meds... what else?),51,180,"Therapy is expensive, and finding a good therapist is hard. Seeing a psychiatrist is expensive, the diagnosis might be inaccurate, and finding the right medication usually requires time-consuming titration and one might experience possible side effects. Basically, working with a mental health professional is costly and takes a LOT of patience... at least from personal experience: over 9 years, I've seen 6 therapists, 2 psychiatrists, received 3 different diagnosis and am regularly on meds - they do seem to help!

  
However, in 2 recent depressive episodes, I noticed that having a regular exercise regime has helped my mood significantly: I'd do HIIT classes 3-4x a week, and a weekly hike. Getting daily sunlight (or blue light) has also helped. No change in meds.

  
I've read that various supplements (magnesium, fish oil, vit Bs), diets (Mediterranean, keto) and types of exercise (weightlifting?) can help... but tbh it's all pretty overwhelming to figure out.

And then I see this sentiment that depressed partners in romantic relationships are a burden. Non-depressed partners going on about how they're tired of their partner's mental health problems, how they suck the life out of them.

Depression is such an isolating illness. No one can reach into your head and take the pain away from you. You have to put in the work and save yourself. People get tired of listening because they have their own problems. And to think that I have to be on high alert not to burden my partner makes me think it might be better if I remain single.

Is it possible to have depression and a relationship and not burden them and make them resent you?",,,,FALSE

I want to get rid of these intrusive thoughts and these groin twitches, because I don't want to hurt anyone. I'm scared of what I might do if the intrusive thoughts get the better of me.

I've been looking around for the symptoms online, and pOCD came up a lot. I'm not sure if that's the case, since apparently some of the symptoms also lined up with anxiety.

It’s not hard to me to admit this, I genuinely believed I was a victim for a long time, I’m not sure why, perhaps I just felt so horrible and bad 24/7, so I just labeled myself a victim in all of these situations, because then I had a REASON an EXPLANATION to why I felt as bad as I do.

I would've died in that house,43,8,"Today I broke down on my boyfriend. I recently put two and two together that my chronic back problems that have already put me in the hospital 3 times, are mostly caused by the years of abuse I endured as a child and teen, being forced into hard labour for up to 12 hours a day. 

It's really hard to face. That I went through so much suffering waiting for freedom, and now that I have it, the abuse is still effecting my quality of life. I really broke down, and ended up having a really beautiful moment with the man I love.

When I'm like that, it's very clear that it hurts him. He holds me so tight, it's like he's trying to hold me together. Just repeating ""I'm here, I'm not going anywhere. You're okay. I love you"".

I told him, no matter what happens between us, or how much times passes, I'll never be able to not love you. I would've died in that house.

Because I would have. For so so many years, I dreamed of someone coming to save me. I dreamed of someone that could love me.

Recording people and posting it online to shame them is a form of abuse,47,8,"There are so many videos like this on the internet and here on reddit.

But sometimes it is a video of a person doing something wrong and then the general consensus seems to be that they deserve to be shamed. well ok. So maybe they deserve punishment but don’t you think that posting videos like this online is like lynching? 

I just saw a video of a woman screaming racist things on a train but it was pretty obvious that she was mentally ill. she was talking to people who weren’t there. I think recording this and putting it online is a form of abuse. We don’t know what’s this person’s problem. we don’t have a back story. But we really like to vilify others and feel self-righteous. and even if she was truly just racist, still what’s the point of putting this online? two wrongs don’t make a right.

I hate working,46,36,"Hello,

I need to know if im alone in this and if not, how other people deal with this.

I work a full time job since 2016. I hate it. I hate that out of 24 hours a day around 10 hours (with commute, unpaid break and getting ready) im forced to stay at a place that I don't want to be in. 

I can't think of a job where I wouldn't be miserable in. I only work because I don't have a choice, I got bills to pay.

It got to a point where I'm really depressed and I can't get out. I could just quit and live of my savings for some time, but then what? How do you deal with this?

I’ve been struggling in school a lot recently, for a variety of reasons. Some due to depression, some due to anxiety, some due to lack of sleep, and some even because my pet died recently. Nobody understands me.

Was it “I’m sorry you have to experience that”? Or even just something as simple as “Is there anything I can do to help you?”? No. None of that. Not even close.

"How to stop associating joy with ""cringe""?",42,7,"Not sure if this is the right sub, but it feels close enough. 

For a few years now I have been completely unable to immerse myself in activities and hobbies and just enjoy things. Any time I see someone experiencing joy I automatically think its cringe and I also cannot express high levels of happiness because it makes me feel cringe.

I'm not sure if its a trauma response from being bullied for my hobbies as a child, my need for perfection, or overexposure to internet culture, but its starting to affect me in the sense I'm hyper aware of it and I don't know how to make it stop. I think my partner is starting to visibly pick up on my constant indifference and lack of enthusiasm towards shared activities and I'm worried that it might causes issues in the near future.

How do you “let go” of trauma/your past?,42,40,"I always see people saying to truly heal trauma or even heal anxiety you need to “let go”. I can guess that they mean like don’t let it effect your life massively but i just don’t understand how to do that or work towards that.

I know there’s no quick way to heal this kind of thing but i genuinely don’t really know any skills on how to manage this stuff if im being honest, a lot of my recovery focus has been on my anxiety rather than my trauma as it was the most pressing issue up until very recently.

Why do grades matter so much?,42,36,"I'm in 10th grade right now and my grades are getting worse and worse and I feel like I have no vision for my future.
Everyone treasures grades so much, my mom, my classmates, teachers (etc.) and it determines so much, where I go after school what I can study, where I get my job.
But I don't really understand why they determine someone's worth so much, if you don't have good grades your future is basically f*cked, even though something as vague as the future is incredibly undetermined in itself.
You could have great talents in art, music, sports, whatever, but if it's not studying it doesn't matter.
I usually prefer to go the more fun way, if there were two projects I could chose from, chances are I'm taking the more entertaining one, even if it pulls my grades down. But people around me care about them so much, it makes me feel like a disappointment even though I'm just doing what interests me.

\- He referred me to a psychologist who was his friend in the new town I was moving to, who gave me two kisses on the corners of my lips as we said goodbye. I never wanted to see him again.

  
Please be respectful, I am ashamed and confused.",,,,FALSE
my psychiatrist says that weed and nicotine are the reason I’m mentally ill. She also used to say that about alcohol but now that I’ve quit she can’t anymore.,39,132,"Is my psychiatrist just against all drugs? should i get a new one? when i tried shrooms they actually gave me more hope to keep on living, yet she told me never to do them again…",,,,FALSE
I hate relying on medication,41,27,"There's not much else to say... I just want to feel okay without having to use medications. I know it's safest for me to stay on medication, but it just feels defeating.
EDIT: I'm talking about psychiatric medication specifically.",,,,FALSE
"I wake up and just think ""For fucks sake another day"" constantly sad all the time.",40,4,"Do you ever feel like you can go to bed and not wake up and that would be bliss ? 

I'm not even like upset I'm just fed up of existing its exhausting. Being lonely is exhausting. Just waking up and trying to function as a normal person is exhausting.. 

I'm so tired, tired of arguments about money, debt constantly, family who need more financial support. 

Tired of working a ""Dead end Job"" with what feels like no way out. 

I think I've just had enough time on the planet. And feeling like this for years and working isn't fair anymore myself. I just want an out ",,,,FALSE
I got a care package and it makes me feel guilty,36,10,"I had surgery recently and some coworkers put the time, effort, and money into making me a care package. I'm so grateful and I really do love everything in it, but I feel so insanely guilty.  It's not 2 snacks and a card either, it's a full-on basket of things that I actually like and would buy myself. I'm not use to this level of care and attention, and I don't feel like I deserve it. I mean I can't repay this in any capacity. A part of me wishes it had been a small something that was just thrown together without much thought; then it would be normal to me, and I would feel better about accepting it. I can't even not accept this. I feel like it would be a bigger insult to turn it away opposed to failing on showing my appreciation.",,,,FALSE
I really hate myself,39,25,"I’m 20f and I hate myself so much that I can’t even breathe sometimes. I’ve never really liked anything about myself , never felt confident or just be able to do anything without overthinking. Recently it’s getting worse. 

I’m in my third year of college. Recently I’ve been so sensitive and irrational. I find it really hard to fit in. I can feel my friends frustration when I just go “i don’t know” or “whatever” or “I don’t care”. But I just can’t help it. It’s so hard for me to trust anyone.

I had a best friend from high school . I don’t know what happened but when she started college( she started college a year after me) she just completely ignored my messages and would sometimes sent me just a “oh” and we just drifted apart. It hurts to this day when I think about it. I think I’m still not able to recover from that. It just made me believe that no one would ever really like me.

I’m a really anxious personality . I get nervous even when it’s not a big deal, my heart rate goes up and I just can’t breathe. I wanna find myself. Be confident.",,,,FALSE
