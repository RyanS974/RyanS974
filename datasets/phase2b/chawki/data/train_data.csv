So you can pretty much forget about reliable 1080P video recording.Update: It is correct that write speed great than 10MB/s is enough for 1080P recording. I need to clarify that the card is very slow when UHS-1 is not enabled. The read/write speeds drop to 13.3/7.9 MB/s. For devices that are a few years old such as Canon T2i which does not support UHS, 1080P recording may not be reliable.

And with this new card I can finally pack all of my music (~56GB), all of my photos, dozens of reference ebooks, and a few videos to boot and still I have around 9GB free as breathing room for my podcatcher. The only real bummer with this card is the speed. Just as I got acclimated to SanDisk's 64GB Extreme Plus level of speed, going back to ordinary class 10 speed that this card has is a little painful. Luckily playing music or even playing videos doesn't oversaturate the read performance. What WILL trip you up however is doing a straightforward copy or move operation while you're listening to something. This card does not seem to handle multiple simultaneous operations without something going awry. So long as you understand it's limitations and you can live with them, the enormous amount of storage you can pack into your phone or tablet is very welcome.So far I've used one of these in a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 N7100, LG G Pad, and a Sony Xperia Z1 Compact - all with success.",Kaggle,9/26/2024 0:00,Positive,Neutral,Neutral

The camera came with a 4 G card which I filled in just over an hour at the local Kart track. I missed the last bit of our race due to insufficient capacity. The battery was still going strong so I needed more card for recording my adventures.This card fits the bill nicely.As a UHS Speed Class 1 (roughly equiv Class 10) card this SD card is quite capable of any photographic or video need up to Full HD (not 2k or 4k). I use a similar card in my Canon 60D and am able to hold around 700 raw images, and a few hours of HD video.Here are some benchmarks for comparison including this card.MacBook Pro Retina SSD430 MB/s write323 MB/s readGeneric Class 6 4GB (Came with Ghost Camera)9.8 MB/s write21 MB/s readSanDisk Extreme Class 10 8GB21 MB/s write23 MB/s readThis Card San Disk Ultra UHC 112 MB/s write45 MB/s readWhat does this mean? It means that you should have no trouble recording HD video reliably with this card. Your camera will be able to save pictures quickly to this card so it is ready to take the next shot. If you fill the card completely it will take roughly 12 minutes to copy all the data off of the card, assuming the device you are copying to can keep up.The tests were done in the built in SD card drive of the MacBook Pro using the included SD Card Adapter.Based on my tests, I would say that if you don't really need a Micro SD, then you should buy a standard SD card, your performance might be better and the price should be lower.

180,Andrew Pollack,"Purchased in November 2012 (less than 18 months ago) for use in my then new Samsung Galaxy S3. It has never been removed from the phone until today when it failed. Since the phone is still fine and the memory card is stored well inside, it's safe to assume this card has suffered no abuse. Today, the card is totally unreadable. It can't be formatted by the phone. The PC doesn't see it at all. It's dead, Jim. I'll be contacting SANDISK about warranty today.UPDATE: I've updated this from 1 start to 4 because although it failed, SANDISK is replacing it at no charge. Sometimes stuff fails. If a manufacturer will stand by it, that speaks well. Nice that because I bought it on Amazon I could search my orders and find the original invoice to use when I contacted them.",kaggle,9/27/2024 0:00,Neutral,Negative,Neutral
